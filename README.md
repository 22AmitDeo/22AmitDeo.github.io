## Work Experience
**AI Agent Development Intern @ International Institute of SDGs and Public Policy Research (_July 2025 - Present_)**
- Designed and deployed intelligent automation agents to handle policy data extraction, stakeholder queries, and
  multi-step reasoning using Python, LangChain, and OpenAI APIs, achieving an 80%, reduction in manual
  intervention across workflows
- Integrated 10+ RESTful APIs and external datasets using Python (requests, asyncio) and FastAPI, enabling
  real-time, context-aware decision-making and improving agent response accuracy by 35%.

## Open Source
**Lightbench**
**GitHub:** [filipnaudot/lightbench](https://github.com/filipnaudot/lightbench)  
**Tech Stack:** Python ¬∑ PyTorch ¬∑ HuggingFace Transformers ¬∑ Git

Contributed to **Lightbench**, a benchmarking suite for evaluating large language models (LLMs).  
Key contributions include:

- Implemented support for **seamless integration of new LLMs**, enhancing extensibility of the platform.  
- **Improved different API Loader's system prompt logic**, ensuring accurate instruction formatting and better model compatibility.

This contribution improved the benchmarking consistency and reduced model integration friction for new LLM architectures.


**OpenSPP** **GitHub:** [digitalgreenorg/OpenSPP](https://github.com/digitalgreenorg/OpenSPP)  
**Tech Stack:** Markdown ¬∑ Shell ¬∑ Ubuntu  

Contributed to OpenSPP by improving developer onboarding:  
- Authored a comprehensive **Native Installation Guide** for environments **without Docker**, improving accessibility for contributors using traditional Linux setups.  

> [Pull Request #12: Add Native Installation Guide](https://github.com/OpenSPP/documentation/pull/12)  
>  Helped expand platform adoption by supporting non-containerized deployments.
